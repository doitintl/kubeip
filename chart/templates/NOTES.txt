ðŸŽ‰ KubeIP v2 Deployment Successful! ðŸŽ‰

Thank you for installing KubeIP v2, ensuring that your Kubernetes nodes are now equipped with static public IP addresses for improved connectivity and reliability.

Next Steps:

1. Verify the Operation: Ensure that KubeIP is running successfully on all desired nodes. You can check the status of the DaemonSet by running:
   
   $ kubectl get daemonset kubeip -n kube-system

2. Check IP Assignment: Ensure that static public IPs are assigned to your nodes. Run the following command to see the assigned IPs:
   
   $ kubectl get nodes -o wide
   
3. Review Logs (Optional): If you want to delve deeper or troubleshoot, you can review the logs of the KubeIP pods:
   
   $ kubectl logs -l app=kubeip -n kube-system
   
4. Update Your Firewall Rules: If you have specific firewall rules or IP whitelists, ensure they are updated to include the static IPs assigned to your nodes.

5. Documentation and Support: For more information on configuration options, troubleshooting, and usage, please visit the [official KubeIP repository](https://github.com/doitintl/kubeip).
